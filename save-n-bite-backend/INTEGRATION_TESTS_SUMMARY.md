# Save-n-Bite Backend - Integration & E2E Tests Summary

## 🎯 Overview

I have created a comprehensive integration and end-to-end testing suite for the Save-n-Bite backend project, including **18 non-functional requirements tests** as requested. This testing framework ensures system reliability, performance, security, and user experience quality.

## 📦 What Was Created

### 1. Test Files Structure
```
tests/
├── __init__.py                 # Test package initialization
├── test_integration.py         # Integration tests (8 test classes, 15+ tests)
├── test_end_to_end.py         # End-to-end tests (5 test classes, 10+ tests)
├── test_non_functional.py     # Non-functional tests (6 test classes, 18+ NFRs)
├── test_config.py             # Test utilities and configuration
└── README.md                  # Comprehensive documentation
```

#### Scalability Requirements (NFR-10 to NFR-11)
- **NFR-10**: Database Connection Scalability (efficient connections)
- **NFR-11**: Memory Usage Efficiency (< 100MB increase)

#### Reliability Requirements (NFR-12 to NFR-14)
- **NFR-12**: Error Handling Reliability (consistent error responses)
- **NFR-13**: Data Integrity Reliability (constraint enforcement)
- **NFR-14**: Transaction Atomicity (proper rollback)

#### Usability Requirements (NFR-15 to NFR-16)
- **NFR-15**: API Response Format Consistency (standardized responses)
- **NFR-16**: Error Message Clarity (helpful error messages)

#### Production Readiness (NFR-17 to NFR-18)
- **NFR-17**: Production Security (debug mode disabled)
- **NFR-18**: Sensitive Data Protection (no data exposure)

## 🚀 How to Run Tests

### Quick Start
```bash
# Run all tests with detailed report
python run_integration_tests.py --all --verbose --report

# Run specific categories
python run_integration_tests.py --integration --verbose
python run_integration_tests.py --e2e --verbose
python run_integration_tests.py --nfr --verbose
```

### Using Django Test Runner
```bash
# Run integration tests
python manage.py test tests.test_integration --verbosity=2

# Run end-to-end tests
python manage.py test tests.test_end_to_end --verbosity=2

# Run non-functional requirements tests
python manage.py test tests.test_non_functional --verbosity=2
```
